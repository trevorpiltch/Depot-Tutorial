# Demo Depot Application 
The demo application for [Agile Web Development with Rails 6](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails6/agile-web-development-with-rails-6/#resource).

## MOTIVATION
I used this book to learn Ruby on Rails practices and practice my Ruby skills. It was a good experience and I learned a 
lot. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that I learned.
- Intro Rails concepts (models, controllers, db, migrations)
- MVC web app architecture
- Intro Javascript concepts (exports, React components)
- Webpack and channels
- Internationalization through I18n
- Unit tests, system tests, fixtures, and helpers
- Emailing the user and responding to the user through rich text
