# Demo Depot Application
The demo application for [Agile Web Development with Rails 6](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails6/agile-web-development-with-rails-6/#resources). One of my [labs](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/Labs) used for learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

## MOTIVATION
I was working on a iOS app that used a rails server as the backend, and wanted to understand how the backend worked. One of my co-workers handed me this book and I built the associated project and learned a lot about Ruby and Rails. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that I learned.
- Intro Rails concepts (models, controllers, db, migrations)
- MVC web app architecture
- Intro Javascript concepts (exports, React components)
- Webpack and channels
- Internationalization through I18n
- Unit tests, system tests, fixtures, and helpers
- Emailing the user and responding to the user through rich text
